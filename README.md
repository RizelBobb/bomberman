How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
I created event listeners, captured the event in parameters in a function, and used key up-down-left-right functions to move my character. I also added audio noises for fun, by putting the audio into the html and using the method .play() at certain keydown events.   

Optimizations
(optional)

I would love to have the maze not be a background only. This way the character is moving through the maze and not just across the background. I would also make the code more dry. 

Lessons Learned:
I learned about key events, which was super cool! Did not know that keys had certain numbers assigned to them.
